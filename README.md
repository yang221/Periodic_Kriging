# Periodic Kriging
Simulation for anvils with hemisphere knurls. \n
"main.R" defines all parameters and functions. \n
"Preprocessing.R" simulates a new anvil surface. \n
"PerKriging.R" uses the kriging interpolation with periodic model. \n
"other_method.R" uses nearest-neighbor, inverse distance weighting, bi-linear and bi-cubic spline. \n
