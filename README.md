# Periodic Kriging
Simulation for anvils with hemisphere knurls
"main.R" defines all parameters and functions.
"Preprocessing.R" simulates a new anvil surface.
"PerKriging.R" uses the kriging interpolation with periodic model.
"other_method.R" uses nearest-neighbor, inverse distance weighting, bi-linear and bi-cubic spline.
